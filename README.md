EarthLCD XLK-10x1-USB  SmartLCD
This is a Very Simple Python Script to drive the EarthLCD XLK-10x1-USB  SmartLCD
It is based on a simple ARM9 Microcontroller which simply sends a frame from USB to the LCD display
one screen at a time. The entire screen must be written each time with this controller. EarthLCD has other 
solutions to drive this LCD under development. This is meant to be a demonstration platform for prototyping 
and small qty production. It is based on the EarthLCD-10.4-1024100 TFT LCD, a 10.4" 1024 X 100  Pixel Display.
What it does is read 16 bit bmp files in order 0001.bmp 0002.bmp ect .
And send them to the display .

Windows drivers included .
